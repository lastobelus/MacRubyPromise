# MacRuby Promise
MacRubyPromise will be a MacRuby application template with automatic code reloading, a live REPL, and other conveniences for dynamic, interactive development of Cocoa Applications.

## Background
### The Name
The name **MacRuby Promise** originates from [this email](http://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/macruby-devel/2011-November/008282.html) from Jean-Denis MUYS to the Macruby devel list. Since his sentiments echoed some of my own in working on my macruby project, and since I was in heavy procrastination mode, I decided to see how much of what he described could be cobbled together from existing things people have already done without writing much new code.
